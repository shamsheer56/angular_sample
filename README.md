# Install Node.js and NPM on Ubuntu



# Install Node.js and NPM on Mac

Installing Node.js and NPM is pretty straightforward using Homebrew. Homebrew handles downloading, unpacking and installing Node and NPM on your system. The whole process (after you have XCode and Homebrew installed) should only take you a few minutes.

    Open the Terminal and type **brew install node**.
    Homebrew downloads some files and installs them. And thatâ€™s it.

To make sure you have Node and NPM installed, run two simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

    1. To see if Node is installed, type **node -v** in Terminal. This should print the version number.
    2. To see if NPM is installed, type **npm -v** in Terminal. This should print the version number.

Check out the git repository, then do

1. **cd angular_sample**
2. **npm install**
3. **ng serve**
